### wireshark does not need to run as root but dumpcap needs superuser network privileges If the code for Wireshark is in bin and not sbin, change “/usr/sbin/” to “/usr/bin/” in the above command
            sudo chown root /usr/sbin/dumpcap
            sudo chmod u+s /usr/sbin/dumpcap
### your current user doesn’t have permission to capture packets from your network card so to solve this probelm you need to add your current user in **_wireshark_** group
            sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER
